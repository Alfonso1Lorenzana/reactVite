# ReactVite

Some new ```assets/``` a folder which handles ```AboutMe.tsx``` which links an image. ```Contact.tsx``` has Name: which the user provides Email address: which is mandatory to put otherwise it won't save. As well as a Message: which is also mandatory again for Contact information.

Then there is ```Portfolio.tsx``` which is the user portfolio of his work.

In case of any Error, that exactly what ```Error.tsx``` provides for. Tried looking at COOLORS.com which gives you certain layouts of colors. Then you can just get that certain style onto your page, for example I wanted Tiffany Blue as my background for a certain page then I can get that color scheme which would be 78E0DC, and make that be background-color.
